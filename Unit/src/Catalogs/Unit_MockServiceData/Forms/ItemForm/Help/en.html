<h2>Part "Body variables"</h2>
<div>
Here it is possible to describe variables calculated on the basis of the request body.</div><div><br></div><div>
If the value of a variable is explicitly specified, then it can be used to filter mock elements.<br>
If there is no "Path to value", then the specified value is simply copied to the final variable.</div><div><br></div><div>
In the path to the body, operations or names of attributes of previously obtained objects are indicated through the "/" symbol.</div><div><br></div><div>
Available operations:</div>
<ul><li>[file] - previously received string should be considered as the file contents</li>
<li>[text] - previously received file contents should be considered as a string</li>
<li>[zip] - previously received file contents should be considered as such as taken from a ZIP archive that needs to be unpacked. 
The next segment is interpreted as the filename from the archive to read the content</li>
<li>[0] - If earlier there was ZIP, in which there is only one file, then this is a command to read that file without specifying a name</li>
<li>[xml] - If earlier there was TEXT, then it must be interpreted as an XML object</li>
<li>[json] - If earlier there was TEXT, then it must be interpreted as an JSON object</li>
<li>[csv] - If there was a TEXT before, then it must be interpreted as an array of substrings delimited by "," (coma). 
But you can specify another separator, for example, a dash: "[csv=-]" or a semicolon: "[csv=;]".</li>
</ul><div>
If an array was obtained earlier, then at the current step you can refer to its element by number (numbering from zero). For example, [text]/[cvs]/0</div>
