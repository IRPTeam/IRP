In the path to the body, operations or names of attributes of previously obtained objects are indicated through the "/" symbol.</div><div><br></div><div>
Available operations:</div>
<ul>
<li>[file] - previously received string should be considered as the file contents</li>
<li>[text] - previously received file contents should be considered as a string</li>
<li>[zip] - previously received file contents should be considered as such as taken from a ZIP archive that needs to be unpacked. 
The next segment is interpreted as the filename from the archive to read the content</li>
<li>[0] - If earlier there was ZIP, in which there is only one file, then this is a command to read that file without specifying a name</li>
<li>[xml] - If earlier there was TEXT, then it must be interpreted as an XML object</li>
<li>[json] - If earlier there was TEXT, then it must be interpreted as an JSON object</li>
