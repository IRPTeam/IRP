Feature: calculation of discounts in a group Minimum (type joings Minimum, Special Offers MaxInRow)

As a sales manager
I want to check the order of discounts in the general group SpecialOffersMaxInRow, subgroup Minimum.
So that discounts in the Minimal group are calculated by choosing the lowest discount in the line.


Background:
	Given I launch TestClient opening script or connect the existing one


# Checking the discount calculation in the group Minimum created inside the group Minimum, which is in the group Maximum
# With Type joins Minimum, discounts in this group will work out the discounts that are least beneficial to the client. 
# Checking for overall discounts on orders (not on lines). 
# Discounts that are outside the group are at least checked by lines and applied according to the rule "most advantageous to the client".
