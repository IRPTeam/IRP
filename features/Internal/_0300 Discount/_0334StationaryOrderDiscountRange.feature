Feature: range discount

As a sales manager
I want to check the calculation and order of applying the range discount (applied to the string manually, summed up with other discounts).
So that the range discount is calculated correctly


Background:
	Given I launch TestClient opening script or connect the existing one

# For each product, a discount is given in the form of a percentage (e.g. Product A from 2 to 5%, Product B from 3 to 7%). 
# A sales rep can set a discount from the specified range in a sales order himself

Scenario: _033401 preparation
	When change the Discount Price 2 manual
	When change the manual setting of the Discount Price 1 discount.
	When move the discount 3+1 Dress and Trousers (not multiplicity), Discount on Basic Partner terms to the group Maximum
	When move the discount 4+1 Dress and Trousers, Discount on Basic Partner terms to the group Maximum
	When move the discount All items 5+1, Discount on Basic Partner terms to the group Maximum
	When change manually setting All items 5+1, Discount on Basic Partner terms
	When  move the Discount Price 1 to Maximum 
	When change manually setting 3+1 Dress and Trousers (not multiplicity), Discount on Basic Partner terms
	When change manually setting 4+1 Dress and Trousers, Discount on Basic Partner terms
