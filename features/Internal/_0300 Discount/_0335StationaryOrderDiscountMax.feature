Feature: create order with special offer type - price type (Type joings MaxInRow, Special Offers MaxInRow)

As a sales manager
I want to check the order of discounts in the general group SpecialOffersMaxInRow, subgroup Maximum (MaxInRow).
So that discounts in the Maximum group are calculated by choosing the highest discount in the line.

# When Type joins MaxInRow in Maximum, the orders in this group with discounts will work out the discounts that are most beneficial to the client. 
# Checking the most advantageous discounts by lines.
